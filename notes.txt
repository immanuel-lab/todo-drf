authentication-Authentication in Django REST Framework 
(DRF) refers to the process of identifying and verifying
 the identity of a user or client making requests to the API



authorization-Authorization is the process of 
determining whether a user is allowed to access a 
particular resource

permissions-permissions determine whether a request should be 
granted or denied access


Permission and authorization are two different concepts in DRF.

Permission is the set of rules that define what a user is allowed to 
do with a particular resource. For example, a user might be allowed to
 read a snippet, but not allowed to update it.

Authorization is the process of determining whether a user is allowed to 
access a particular resource. For example, a user might be authenticated,
 but not authorized to access a snippet that they do not own.
